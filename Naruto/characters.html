						<p> <strong><i>Naruto Uzumaki</i></strong>, a character whose popularity broke through 
						the bubble of the anime community and almost developed into a household name. 
						At the start of the series, Naruto’s ideals were truly inspiring to the youth. 
						His sentiments were so far-reaching that he became- to his fans, 
						at least- more than a 2D character. It’s only natural for Naruto to head this list.</p>

					<div class = "media-body">
						<p> <strong><i>Sasuke</i></strong> is one of the main characters of the series. 
						He always went head-to-head against Naruto-- his lifelong rival. 
						As polar opposites, Naruto and Sasuke chose different shinobi paths, 
						each with his own conviction and ideals.</p>

						<p>There are only a few characters who could compete with Kakashi in terms of innate talent. 
						And one of those who could compete with, and even surpass Kakashi is no one other than Itachi Uchiha.
						Dubbed as the best boy of Naruto by the fandom, 
						<strong><i>Itachi’s</i></strong> popularity is leagues above a bunch of Shonen protagonists. 
						Classifying him as one of anime’s most famous characters is not an overstatement.</p>

						<p><strong><i>Kakashi</i></strong> is a character that experienced way too much for his age. 
						His mother died in his infancy, followed by his father less than a decade later -- 
						and that was only the beginning of his miserable life.
						However, despite going through so much; Kakashi held on and accomplished 
						what the average ninja could never hope to. His genius was easily unrivaled during his era.</p>

						<p><strong><i>Minato "Yellow Flash" Namikaze</i></strong> was a genius of his era. 
						He lived for only so many years, but the legacy he built still lives to this date.
						Even before debuting, Minato was one of the most hyped-up characters. 
						Not to mention his identity as Naruto's father, 
						just his achievements and sacrifices are enough to elevate him to an unforgettable character.</p>
